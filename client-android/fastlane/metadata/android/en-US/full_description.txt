<p><i>stasis</i> is a backup and recovery system with an emphasis on security and privacy; no personal information is collected, no unencrypted data leaves a client device and all encryption keys are fully in the control of their owner.</p><blockquote>A <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stasis_(fiction)' target='_blank'>stasis</a> ˈsteɪsɪs/ or <b>stasis field</b>, in science fiction, is a confined area of space in which time has been stopped or the contents have been rendered motionless.</blockquote><p><br><b>Why?</b></p><ul><li><b>Trust Issues:</b> Do you trust your backup or infrastructure/storage provider with your unencrypted data?</li><li><b>Multi-Device:</b> How many backup providers would you need to cover all types of devices you own?</li><li><b>Self-Hosted:</b> What if your backup provider goes out of business?</li></ul><p><b>Goals</b></p><ul><li>Recover user data from total failure or device loss</li><li>Replicate data to local and remote/cloud storage</li><li>Encrypt data before it leaves a device</li><li>Manage all device backups from a single service</li></ul><p><i>Along with <a href='https://github.com/sndnv/provision' target='_blank' rel='nofollow noopener'><code>provision</code></a>, he goal is to be able to grab a blank/off-the-shelf device and recover the original system in an automated and repeatable way.</i></p><p><br><b>Features:</b></p><ul><li><b><a href='https://github.com/sndnv/stasis/wiki/Architecture-%3A%3A-Encryption' target='_blank' rel='nofollow noopener'>Client-only Encryption</a>:</b> encryption and decryption is done by client applications; the server never deals with unencrypted data or metadata</li><li><b><a href='https://github.com/sndnv/stasis/wiki/Architecture-%3A%3A-Secrets' target='_blank' rel='nofollow noopener'>Device-only Secrets</a>:</b> user credentials and device secrets do not leave the device on which they were entered/generated</li><li><b><a href='https://github.com/sndnv/stasis/wiki/Architecture-%3A%3A-Core-Persistence' target='_blank' rel='nofollow noopener'>Default Redundancy</a>:</b> copies of a device's encrypted data are sent to multiple nodes by default (local and remote)</li><li><b><a href='https://github.com/sndnv/stasis/wiki/Architecture-%3A%3A-Data-Stores' target='_blank' rel='nofollow noopener'>Hybrid Data Storage</a>:</b> various storage backends (<a href='https://geode.apache.org/' target='_blank' rel='nofollow noopener'>Apache Geode</a>, <a href='https://scala-slick.org/' target='_blank' rel='nofollow noopener'>Slick</a>, in-memory, file-based) are supported and used</li><li><b>Secrets Escrow:</b> (TODO) enables storing encrypted device secrets on the server to simplify recovering of a lost or replaced device</li><li><b>Serverless Mode:</b> (TODO) enables creating backups and recovering from them without the presence of a server</li></ul><p><b>Note:</b> currently, this app requires a server counter-part.
